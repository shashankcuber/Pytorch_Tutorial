# Pytorch_Tutorial
Hola !!

I am sharing some pytorch tutorial codes which I made while learning pytorch from this awesome tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&t=15481s .

The code contains comments which can help you learn pytorch without going through the whole video tutorial of 4 hours. I hope this can be a time saving stuff for you. But I highly recommend going through the video tutorial if you are not able to find something in details and requires more in depth.


Content:
1. Basic operations on tensors (Basic_Pytorch_Tutorial.ipynb)
   a. Mathematical operations on tensors
   b. Autograd for optimization via gradient
   c. Basic model construction of Linear Regression
2. Building a complete model design of Logistic Regression (Logistic_Regression_Pytorch.ipynb)
3. Dataset and dataloader (Dataset_Dataloader_Pytorch.ipynb)
   a. How to load dataset
   b. Using DataLoader to break dataset in batches to be used in training loop
   c. Using transforms to change the dtype of dataset using transform and composed transform in pytorch
4. Activation Functions and CrossEntropy Loss(Acitvation Function and CrossEntropy Loss.ipynb)
   a. Few basic mathematical formulation and way to use them in pytorch
   b. It involves some good observation regarding CrossEntropy loss and softmax activation function
5. Building and end to end Feed Forward Neural Network on MNIST dataset (FeedForwardNN.ipynb)
6. Building CNN from scratch using pytorch on CIFAR-10 dataset(CNN_Pytorch_on_CIFAR.ipynb)

I will keep adding more stuff to this repository in pytorch like how to visualise the tensor board and how to save the model.

Feel free to fork and contribute to this repository.
